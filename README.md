# glance-vmr
augmented weakly supervised video moment retrieval

task: find start and end timestamps for a moment described by a natural language query

-augmented to match weakly supervision with additional glance marking cost (O(1) trivial~) 

-adds gaussian aligment module to weakly supervised vmr models to make it truly modular 

-dataset augmentation and reannotation
